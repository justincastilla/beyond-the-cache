# Beyond the Cache with Redis + Node.js

If you’re like a lot of developers, you’ve probably used Redis. You’ve probably used it as a cache—which it does amazingly—and you’ve probably cached strings. But Redis is much, much more than just a cache. It can be a message broker using queues, streams, and pub-sub. It can be a multi-model, in-memory, NoSQL database storing all sorts of data structures like hashes, lists, sets, and binary data. It can even be extended using modules to add new commands, new data structures, and new capabilities.

In this workshop, I’ll show you how to take full advantage of all that Redis can do from your Node.js applications—starting from the very beginning with a primer on Redis. We’ll cover the basics—talking to Redis from the command line and exploring its capabilities. Then, we’ll take advantage of those capabilities from Node.js, building some simple yet surprising powerful applications using the low-level Node.js client—Node Redis.

After that, we’ll look at ways to extend Redis with modules, with an emphasis on using Search to find the data and JSON to store documents. We’ll finish the day by looking at Redis OM, a high-level library that uses some of these modules to map JSON documents to objects in your application.

Redis does a lot more than you probably thought. The whole point of this workshop is to show you that “more” and give you the knowledge to take greater advantage of the Redis you are already using. So, let’s start learning and start using!
