# Beyond the Cache with Redis + Node.js

Greetings. This repository and the code and prose within it are part of an in-person workshop called _Beyond the Cache with Redis + Node.js_. If you're taking the workshop, that's awesome. I'm glad you're here. I'll guide you through all the steps in the workshop. Do something socially appropriate to grab my attention if you have a question.

If you've stumbled upon this repository after a long stint of googling, that's cool too. You're welcome to use the content herein to further your education. That said, while the content here is perfectly useable, it is intended to be used alongside in-person instruction. So, it might be a bit terse at times—light on the explanaining and more heavy on the doing.

Many of you have probably heard of Redis, or even used it. It's a cache, right? It can be a cache, a very good cache, but Redis does a lot more. The whole point of this workshop is to show you that “more” and give you the knowledge to take greater advantage of the Redis you are already love.

Take a look at the [outline](docs/00-OUTLINE.md) and let's get started.
